              background in UI/UX design and a knack for creating impactful and

              helped me utilize my imagination and creativity to connect with
              diverse audiences and tell compelling African stories. My
              interpersonal skills make me a collaborative team player with
              strong communication skills who can work individually and as part
              of a cross-functional team. Technology has connected me to the
              world in many ways and inspired me to create. Now, it's my turn to
